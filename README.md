Title of the project : QR-Based-Food-Ordering-System
Detailed Explanation :

We are developing a QR-Based-Food-Ordering-System for our college project. The project includes the following functionalities:

Customer Side:

Each table in the restaurant has a QR code containing the restaurant's URL and table number.
Customers scan the QR code.
They are directed to the web landing page via the QR code.
The landing page displays the menu options.
Customers can browse all available dishes.
Customers select the dishes they want to order.
All selected items are added to the cart.
The order is submitted.
A bill is generated, which includes the names of the dishes, their quantities, the table number, prices, GST, and other charges.
Customers are taken to the payment section, which allows for payment via QR generation or a direct payment app link.
Chef & Waiter Side:

In the kitchen, there is an order section that shows which dishes have been ordered by which table, along with the bill details.
After preparing the order, the waiter serves the items to the customer’s table.
Admin Side:

A fully functional admin page.
Features for managing the menu, including adding new dishes, changing prices, and modifying other related functions.
A database management page.
Abstract
The Restaurant Management System is designed to streamline the ordering, billing, and management processes within a restaurant. Customers can easily scan a QR code at their table to access the menu, select dishes, and place orders online. The system generates a bill that includes all charges and enables quick, hassle-free payments via QR or direct app links. Chefs receive real-time order details, and waiters are notified when the food is ready to be served. Administrators can manage the menu and restaurant data through an interactive dashboard. This project enhances operational efficiency, reduces errors, and improves the customer experience.

Objective or Goal
The primary goal of the Restaurant Management System is to enhance customer satisfaction, streamline restaurant operations, and minimize manual effort in order processing and billing. The system aims to:

Simplify the ordering and payment processes for customers.
Ensure real-time communication between the kitchen and waitstaff.
Provide a dynamic, user-friendly admin interface for managing menu items and restaurant data.
Technical Approach

Uniqueness

Automated Flow: From the moment a customer scans the QR code to the completion of payment, the process is entirely digital, minimizing human intervention and errors.
AI-powered Chatbot: A chatbot suggests personalized food combinations based on customer preferences, enhancing the customer experience.
Seamless Payment Integration: Payment options include both QR code generation for online transactions and direct app links for convenience.
Flowchart
Customer Side:
